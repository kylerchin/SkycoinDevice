# SkycoinDevice
The aim of this project is too create an off-grid mesh network communications mobile device running on the [Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net/) network, and could run a node on board. The network could then relay transactions and Skywire, A Decentralized Internet, a wireless mesh network that pays you for supporting it. Fiber would then connect the local wifi network to LoRa radio waves.

After a internet connection has been established, other blockchains could then relay transactions using Skywire.

This device was inspired by https://n-o-d-e.net/meshdevice.html, so go check N-O-D-E out first to get an idea of what this project is. The hardware is similar, but board types can vary.
